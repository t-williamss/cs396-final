In some cases, computers are now better at identifying people by their face than humans are. But how do these systems work? Who uses them and why?",

            "description": "Data is a word we've been hearing a lot of these days. Databases too. But what really is data, and where does it come from? How is it collected in databases and used to label and target people? And how does all this affect you (or has it already?) This module discusses all that, and more, while giving you the chance to think about how you personally fit into the equation.",

This technology can be used to unlock your phone, automatically tag you in photos, or verify your identity at airports. These systems can introduce new convenience in our lives, but as with much of the convenience technology brings, it comes with a cost. As these technologies become more and more advanced, they put personal privacy at risk. The first step in understanding the risk of facial recognition systems is understanding what they do and how they work. In this learning module, you will learn:",
